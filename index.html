<h1>23rd International Microlensing Conference</h1>
<h3>28-30 January, 2019 / Center for Computational Astrophysics / New York City</h3>

<p>

The Center for Computational Astrophysics is pleased to invite the astronomical and computational
communities to the 23rd International Microlensing Conference: Computational Challenges in
Microlensing, to be held at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) in New York City on
28-30 January 2019. This meeting will be held in conjunction with the Microlensing Hack (half-)Week
that will be held at the CCA on 30 January 2019-1 February 2019.
    
</p><p>

The particular focus of this year’s meeting will the computational challenges that confront the
microlensing method, particularly challenges that will be relevant to the microlensing program of
NASA’s upcoming Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission that will also be addressed in
the Hack (half-)Week. An additional focus of this meeting will be the implications of microlensing
results for other exoplanet studies, both theoretical and observational. Other observational and
theoretical microlensing results will also be discussed.

</p><p>
    
The deadline for abstract submission and regular registration is 30 November 2018. Limited funds are
available to travel support, and the deadline for applications for travel support is also 30 November 2018.
