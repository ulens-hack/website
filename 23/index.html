<p>

The <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/">Center for Computational Astrophysics</a> is pleased to invite the astronomical and computational
communities to the 23rd International Microlensing Conference: Computational Challenges in
Microlensing, to be held at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a> in New York City on
28-30 January 2019.
This meeting will be held in conjunction with the <a href="https://hack.microlensing.science">Microlensing Hack Session</a>
that will also be held at the Flatiron Institute on 30 January 2019-1 February 2019.

</p><p>

The particular focus of this year’s meeting will the computational challenges that confront the
microlensing method, particularly challenges that will be relevant to the microlensing program of
NASA’s upcoming <a href="https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)</a> mission that will also be addressed in
the <a href="https://hack.microlensing.science">Hack Session</a>.
An additional focus of this meeting will be the implications of microlensing
results for other exoplanet studies, both theoretical and observational.
Other observational and
theoretical microlensing results will also be discussed.

</p><p>

The deadline for abstract submission and regular registration is 30 November 2018.
Limited funds are available to travel support, and the deadline for applications for travel support is 19 October 2018.

<p>
The organizers are committed to making this meeting productive and enjoyable
for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including

speak, in confidence, to any member of the organizing committee.
</p>

<p>
This code of conduct is based on the "London Code of Conduct", as originally
designed for the conference "Accurate Astrophysics. Correct Cosmology", held in
London in July 2015.
</p>

<h2>Social Media Policy</h2>

<p>
If any attendee asks that something not be shared on social media, respect that
request. If you are presenting anything that you do not want shared on
social media, simply inform other participants clearly that they should not share it,
for example, by putting the request on a slide at the beginning of the talk.
